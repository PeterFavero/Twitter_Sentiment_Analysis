Welcome to this repository! Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool in natural language processing (NLP) that helps determine the underlying sentiment in textual data. This project focuses on analyzing tweets about ChatGPT, ironically annotated for sentiment using ChatGPT itself.

A collab of the model (used originally to train it), and pretrained SVM and BERT-NN models to load and test can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xeHpNlkm8RegjaLBHLwsunC7UmM__x1O?usp=sharing).
